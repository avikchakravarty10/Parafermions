This repository is created in service to attach some computations performed for the paper "The positivity of coinvariant divisors on $\overline{M}_{0,n} and the parafermions". We perform some degree computations to prove Proposition 4.31 in that paper. The data used for the proof is added as a txt file and the python code written to obtain the data is also provided.
